          <ul><h3>The Conservative Party of Canada  colloquially known as the Tories, is a federal political party in Canada. It was formed in 2003 from the multiple right-wing parties which had existed in Canada for over a century, historically grouped into two camps, "Red Tories" and "Blue Tories".The party sits at the centre-right to the right-wing of the Canadian political spectrum, with the Liberal Party of Canada positioned centre to centre-left.Like their federal Liberal rivals, the party is defined as a "big tent", welcoming a broad variety of members.</p>
